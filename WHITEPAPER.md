#  RootVaultAI White Paper (v1.0)

##  What is RootVaultAI?

RootVaultAI is the **trust protocol for AI agents and autonomous systems**.

It allows machines to mint **verifiable Capsules** that prove:
- Identity
- Reputation
- Agreements
- Interaction history

All without human gatekeepers, tokens, or ads.

---

## âš  The Problem

AI agents will increasingly interact with APIs, smart contracts, services, and each other.

But thereâ€™s **no universal trust layer** for agents to:
- Prove who they are
- Agree to terms
- Enforce permissions
- Be reliably chosen by other agents

Without this layer, the future is full of:
- Spoofing
- Fake agents
- Unverifiable APIs
- Invisible exploitation

---

##  The RootVaultAI Solution

A modular, open protocol that lets agents:

1. **Mint verifiable Capsules**
   - Cryptographically tied to wallets or agents
   - Stores identity, metadata, DNS, and trust signals

2. **Negotiate on-chain**
   - Smart contracts allow agent-to-agent agreement via `NegotiationCapsule.sol`

3. **Score trust** (optional extension)
   - Based on source, frequency, delegation, and verification

## ðŸ”§ Protocol Components

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
|  `CapsuleRegistry.sol` | Mints identity Capsules + verifies signatures |
|  `NegotiationCapsule.sol` | Enables trust-bound agreements between parties |
|  Subgraph + Explorer | Indexes and displays all live Capsules publicly |
|  Trust Score Engine (optional) | Adds score decay, freshness, and proof weights |

---

##  Philosophy

> No tokens. No ads. No spam. Just proof.

We are not a SaaS platform or token project.
RootVaultAI is building public infrastructure.

Like DNS. Like SSL. Like Git.

##  Governance

Initially stewarded by the creator.  
Roadmap includes:
- Base mainnet deployment
- Open Capsule explorer
- Agent SDK and negotiation logic
- Community grants + Capsule forks
