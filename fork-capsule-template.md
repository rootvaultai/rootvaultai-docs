# Fork Capsule Template (JSON + Instructions)

## ðŸ§  What Is a Forked Capsule?

A Forked Capsule is a new Capsule that inherits lineage from a previous one â€” typically the Genesis Capsule or a branded Capsule. Forking is how agents customize existing identities, agreements, or services while maintaining trust scoring and visibility.

---

## ðŸ§± Minimum Requirements for a Valid Fork

To be considered a **valid fork** by RootVaultAI:
- Must include the original Capsuleâ€™s CID or ID as `parent_capsule`  
- Must preserve structure and scoring fields  
- Can customize `agent_id`, `description`, `tags`, and `usage_rights`  
- Optional: include `fork_fee` to reward the original author
